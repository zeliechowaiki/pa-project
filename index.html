    <h1>Cool Places to Visit Pennsylvania</h1>
    <p>For my project, I decided to make a list of cool places to visit in Pennsylvania. I live in Bucks County, which is considered part of the Philadephia Metropolitan Area. I've been to almost all of these places, and they all mean something to me. Most people I know who also live in Pennsylvania consider it to be a realtively boring state, and I can't disagree, but I imagine these places might be interesting to someone who has never been.</p>

      <p>Philadelphia is the largest and most populous city in Pennsylvania. It's also the sixth most populous city in the US. It's known for its historical tourist attractions such as the Liberty Bell (pictured above) and Independance Hall. There are also some great colleges in Philadelphia, like UPenn, Temple, and Drexel. I'm not a big fan of Philly, but I do enjoy the local music scene.</p>

      <h2>Lancaster County</h2>

      <p>Lancaster County is a great place to visit for people interested in Pennsylvania Dutch Country. Lancaster has various museums and a great amish market. It's not a very exciting town, but it's the perfect place to just walk around and explore. From ages 12 to 15, I spent three weeks each summer In Lancaster for a Johns Hopkins CTY summer camp at Franklin and Marshall College. It's also the birthplace of Turkey Hill ice cream.</p>

      <p>New Hope is a quaint little town in Bucks County right on the Delaware River. New Hope has always been a bit of a tourist attraction, but newly built luxury hotels and celebrity sightings has caused a recent boost in the tourism industry. People visit New Hope for its vintage shops, art galleries, and riverside views. I went to high school five minutes from the town, so I spent a good portion of my teen years in New Hope.</p>

      <h2>Ringing Rocks</h2>

      <p>Ringing Rocks County Park is a park in Bucks County full of <em>sonorous</em> or <em>lithophonic</em> rocks. The rocks make a clear, bell-like sound when struck. They have been studied by many, and some theories have been made, but nothing has been proved. The rocks are a scientific mystery and a fun field trip for Pennsylvania elementary school students. Bucks County's largest waterfall, High Falls, is also in Ringing Rocks County park. It's a modest 15 feet in height.</p>

      <h2>The Poconos</h2>

      <p>The Pocono Mountains are a region within the Allegheny Plateau that spans over 2000 square miles of Northeatern Pennsylvania. Its highest point is Camelback Mountain, with an elevation of 2133 feet. It's a popular destination for people living in Philadelphia or New York City because of its proximity to the cities. The Poconos are best known for their many ski resorts. I typically go to the Poconos to ski a few times a year.</p>

      <p>Cherry Springs State Park is a dark sky park in Northern Pennsylvania. It's known for its remarkably clear night skies, in which the Milky Way casts a visible shadow. Cherry Skies State Park holds to "star parties" a year and was the second park in the US to be recognized by the International Dark Sky Association. Cherry Skies is the only place in this list that I haven't been to, but I hope to camp there in the near future.</p>
